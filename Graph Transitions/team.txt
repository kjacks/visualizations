Team Members: Alison Tai, Kirk Jackson, Matt Long

The three of us worked together on setting up the initial 3 buttons and the 
general structure of a2.pde. We implemented a single transition (line to bar)
together. 

Kirk implemented the stacked bar chart, theme river chart, their 
transitions, and the bar to line chart. 

Matt implemented the rose chart, rose chart transition, pie to bar transition,
and bar to pie transition. 

Ali implemented the pie chart, line to pie transition, pie to line transition, 
and worked out the bugs in getitng the transitions to run smoothly.
