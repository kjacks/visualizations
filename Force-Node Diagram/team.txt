Alison Tai, Kirk Jackson, and Matt Long

Alison worked the calculations for acceleration, velocity, and displacement.

Kirk worked on the Coulomb's force calculations.

Matt worked on the Hooke's law calculations.

We all collectively worked on the program flow and data structures, the
fancy color-changing algorithm, the force_middle to center the tree,
and general debugging.
