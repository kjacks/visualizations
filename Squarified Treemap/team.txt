INPUT: To input a file, set the String file (in a1.pde) to the title of the
file.

Ali worked primarily with squarify algorithm. Matt and Kirk built the parser 
and organized the hierarchal structure of the data. The three of us worked 
together on everything else in the project - particularly putting the pieces
together.
